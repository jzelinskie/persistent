[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jzelinskie/persistent)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jzelinskie/persistent)

The persistent package defines various persistent data structures; that is, data structures that can be efficiently copied and modified in sublinear time.

This is a fork of an internal library from [golang.org/x/tools][tools] made generic.
